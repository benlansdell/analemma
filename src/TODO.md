TODO:

* Fix text issues: why do labels disappear?
* Change camera selection/angle issues
* Currently: solstice and perihelion occur at same time... need to rotate earth's axis so that it occurs
  on Dec 21st. Make it so we can precess as desired
* Make draw trails button work
* Clean up code
* What to do about planets with retrograde rotations?
  Take these out...

DONE

x Add a set to Earth's parameteres button
x Add a pause button
x Refine camera modes
x Draw trails behind apparent sun -- so it draws the analemma
x Turn moon off...
x Make one camera mode be at center of earth (turn earth and moon off)
x Highlight EOT
x Show text -- the day, month, etc, and the eot
x Add option to change obliquity of earth
x Label parts of the orbit -- perihelion, aphelion, solstice, equinox, etc.
x Make it so we can select which object we use as the center
x How to display the mean sun ??
x Display celestial sphere, equator and ecliptic?
x A plane/circle that indicates solar noon
x A plane that indicates mean solar noon (e.g. equation of time)
x Make it so we can adjust the analemma shape
x Make window smaller -- want this to fit in to the page we're drawing. 
x Make it so I can change earth's orbit
x Make controls display how fast we're moving -- time/time
x Change orbits to ellipses -- actual ellipses, following Kepler's law
x Make sizes to scale?
x Make background dynamic
x Only include earth and sun
x Add a limit to how far we can scroll out
